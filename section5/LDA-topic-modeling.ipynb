    "doc2 = \"This book describes the emerging ﬁeld of revenue management and its applications across a broad spectrum of business activity. It recounts the history and development of revenue management and addresses the analytical tools needed to integrate revenue management into management generally and ﬁnancial and accounting practice in particular. Revenue Management discusses and assesses various pricing practices and other revenue management techniques. It gives particular attention to the role of capacity analysis and the connection of revenue management to the theory of constraints. While revenue management originated in the service industries, it is now practiced across a broad spectrum of business and not-for-proﬁt organizations. This book will be a useful guide to managers at all levels who wish to give greater consideration to the importance of revenue management in their organizations. The second edition reorganizes the presentation of the subject, adds many new examples, and concludes with a chapter on emerging issues.\"\n",

Arguably our extraordinary evolutionary success has much to do with our subtle and highly developed ability to interact with and influence each other. In this volume, leading international researchers review and integrate contemporary theory and research on the many ways people influence each other, considering both explicit, direct, and implicit, indirect influence strategies. Three sections examine fundamental processes and theory in social influence research, the role of cognitive processes and strategies in social influence phenomena, and the operation of social influence mechanisms in group settings. By applying the latest research to a wide range of interpersonal phenomena, this volume greatly advances our understanding of social influence mechanisms in strategic social interaction, and should be of interest to all students, researchers and practitioners interested in the dynamics of everyday interpersonal behavior.\"\"\"\n",
